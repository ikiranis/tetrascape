# 🎮 Tetrascape - Escape Puzzle Tetris

Welcome to **Tetrascape**, a unique twist on the classic Tetris game that transforms into an exciting escape-puzzle adventure! Complete stage objectives to help your character escape through increasingly challenging levels.

## 🎯 Game Overview

Tetrascape combines traditional Tetris mechanics with escape-game elements. Your goal is not just to clear lines, but to achieve specific objectives within time and block limits to progress through 5 challenging stages. Watch your character move along the escape track below the game board as you make progress toward your goals!

## 🕹️ How to Play

### Basic Controls
- **A/D or ←/→**: Move piece left/right
- **S or ↓**: Soft drop (faster fall)
- **W or ↑**: Rotate piece clockwise
- **Q**: Rotate piece counterclockwise
- **Space**: Hard drop (instant drop)

### Power-ups
Use special power-ups to overcome difficult situations:

- **🧨 Dynamite** (D key): Drops the current piece to the bottom and creates a 3x3 explosion around each block, clearing surrounding pieces
- **🪄 Shovel** (F key): Clears an entire vertical column where your current piece would land
- **🔄 Trade** (G key): Swaps your current piece with the next piece
- **⏰ Slow** (H key): Temporarily reduces the game speed for easier placement

## 🏃‍♂️ Character System

Your character appears below the game board and moves along the escape track based on your progress:

- **👤 Waiting**: Character is idle when not actively playing
- **💪 Working**: Character shows effort when you're actively placing pieces and making progress
- **🏃 Escaping**: Character runs toward the exit when close to completing objectives

Each power-up triggers unique character animations:
- Dynamite: Throwing and explosion animation
- Shovel: Digging animation  
- Trade: Handoff gesture animation
- Slow: Time manipulation effect
